# leetcode-typescript-stl
When I use typescript to finish problems in leetcode.com, I always find myself missing basic data structure in a file that is able copy to the leetcode.com to solve problem. What's more there are a lot of people have the same problem. Therefore, I create this repo to help people around.


Requirement:
1. All STL must compiled to one ts file.
2. All STL uses the latest typescript feature.
3. All STL have the common leetcode data structe needs. Like queue needs to get tail and head.
4. All data structure could be easily print with toString().

Here is Google TypeScript Style Guide.
